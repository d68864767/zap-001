# Time Tracking Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Zap for time tracking. This Zap integrates with a time-tracking tool to start or stop a timer, making it easy to track time spent on different tasks with the press of a button.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- A physical button that integrates with Zapier (like Flic or a similar IoT button).
- A Zapier account to create and manage your Zaps.
- An account with a time-tracking tool (like Toggl).

## Step-by-step Guide

1. **Set up your button**: First, you need to set up your IoT button to work with Zapier. Follow the instructions provided by the button manufacturer to connect it to Zapier.

2. **Create a new Zap**: Log in to your Zapier account and click on the 'Make a Zap' button.

3. **Choose your trigger**: Select your IoT button as the trigger. This means that the Zap will start whenever you press the button.

4. **Choose your action**: Select your time-tracking tool as the action. This means that the Zap will start or stop a timer in your time-tracking tool whenever the button is pressed.

5. **Configure your action**: Depending on the time-tracking tool you're using, you'll need to specify whether you want the timer to start or stop when the button is pressed. You might also need to select a specific project or task to track.

6. **Test your Zap**: Zapier allows you to test your Zaps to make sure they're working correctly. Press the button and check if the timer in your time-tracking tool starts or stops as expected.

7. **Turn on your Zap**: If everything is working correctly, turn on your Zap. From now on, you can start or stop your timer by simply pressing the button.

## Troubleshooting

If your Zap isn't working as expected, here are a few things you can try:

- Check your internet connection: Both your IoT button and your time-tracking tool need to be connected to the internet to work with Zapier.
- Check your Zap configuration: Make sure you've selected the correct trigger and action, and that you've configured your action correctly.
- Check your button: Make sure your button is working correctly and is properly connected to Zapier.

If you're still having trouble, feel free to ask for help. Happy time tracking!
