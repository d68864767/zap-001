# Data Backup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a Zap that backs up new files from your computer to a cloud storage service whenever you press a button.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A physical button that integrates with Zapier (like Flic or a similar IoT button).
- A Zapier account to create and manage your Zaps.
- A cloud storage service account (like Google Drive or Dropbox).

## Steps

1. **Set up your button**: First, you need to set up your IoT button to work with Zapier. This will vary depending on the button you're using, but generally, you'll need to connect it to your Wi-Fi network and then link it to your Zapier account.

2. **Create a new Zap**: Log in to your Zapier account and click on the "Make a Zap" button.

3. **Choose your trigger**: Select your IoT button as the trigger app and choose the "Button Pressed" trigger event. Click on "Continue".

4. **Connect your button**: Follow the instructions to connect your IoT button to Zapier. Once connected, test the trigger by pressing your button. Click on "Continue".

5. **Choose your action**: Select your cloud storage service (like Google Drive or Dropbox) as the action app and choose the "Upload File" action event. Click on "Continue".

6. **Connect your cloud storage service**: Follow the instructions to connect your cloud storage service to Zapier. Once connected, set up the file upload. You'll need to specify the source of the file (your computer) and the destination folder in your cloud storage. Click on "Continue".

7. **Test your Zap**: Zapier will provide an option to test your Zap. If everything is set up correctly, a test file should be uploaded to your cloud storage when you press your button.

8. **Name and turn on your Zap**: Finally, give your Zap a name and turn it on. Now, whenever you press your button, new files from your computer will be backed up to your cloud storage service.

## Troubleshooting

If your Zap isn't working as expected, here are a few things to check:

- Make sure your IoT button is connected to the internet and linked to your Zapier account.
- Check that your cloud storage service is connected to Zapier and that you have enough storage space for new files.
- Ensure that the source and destination paths for your file upload are correct.

If you're still having trouble, feel free to ask for help. Happy Zapping!
