# Quick Notes to Self Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Zap for sending quick voice memos or text notes to your email or a note-taking app like Evernote. This Zap can be triggered with a button click.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A physical button that integrates with Zapier (like Flic or a similar IoT button).
- A Zapier account to create and manage your Zaps.
- An email account or a note-taking app account that your Zap will interact with.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set up your trigger**: Log in to your Zapier account and click on 'Make a Zap'. Choose your IoT button as the trigger app and select 'Button Pressed' as the trigger event. Follow the prompts to connect your button to Zapier.

2. **Set up your action**: Choose your email provider or note-taking app as the action app. If you're using an email provider, select 'Send Email' as the action event. If you're using a note-taking app, select 'Create Note' as the action event. Follow the prompts to connect your email or note-taking app to Zapier.

3. **Configure your action**: In the 'Set up action' step, you can customize the content of your note or email. For example, you can set the subject to be 'Quick Note' and the body to be the text or voice memo you want to send.

4. **Test your Zap**: Click on 'Test & Continue' to make sure your Zap works as expected. If everything is set up correctly, you should receive a test note or email.

5. **Turn on your Zap**: Once you're happy with your Zap, turn it on. Now, whenever you press your button, it will trigger your Zap and send a quick note to your email or note-taking app.

Remember, you can always go back and edit your Zap if you want to change anything. Enjoy your new automated quick note system!
