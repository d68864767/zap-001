# Zapier Automation Project

This project is about creating innovative Zaps (automations) that can be triggered with a button click. The Zaps are designed to automate various tasks and workflows, making your day-to-day activities more efficient.

## Project Description

The project includes the following Zaps:

1. **Email Digest of Daily Tasks**: A Zap that compiles a list of your tasks for the day from your task management tool and sends you an email digest.
2. **Social Media Post**: A Zap that posts a predefined message or image to your social media accounts whenever you press the button.
3. **Meeting Scheduler**: A Zap to send out a scheduling link to a predefined group of recipients to quickly set up meetings.
4. **Data Backup**: A Zap to back up new files from your computer to a cloud storage service whenever you press the button.
5. **Customer Feedback Request**: A Zap to send an automated feedback request email to a customer after an interaction.
6. **Time Tracking**: A Zap that integrates with a time-tracking tool to start or stop a timer.
7. **Quick Notes to Self**: A Zap to send quick voice memos or text notes to your email or a note-taking app.

## Getting Started

To implement any of these ideas, youâ€™ll need:

- A physical button that integrates with Zapier (like Flic or a similar IoT button).
- A Zapier account to create and manage your Zaps.
- Accounts with any other services your Zap interacts with (like social media platforms, cloud storage services, etc.).

Each Zap has a dedicated guide that provides detailed instructions on how to set it up:
