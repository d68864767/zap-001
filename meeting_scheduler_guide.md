# Meeting Scheduler Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a Zap that sends out a scheduling link to a predefined group of recipients to quickly set up meetings. This Zap is triggered by a button press.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A physical button that integrates with Zapier (like Flic or a similar IoT button).
- A Zapier account to create and manage your Zaps.
- An account with a scheduling tool (like Calendly).
- A list of recipients for the scheduling link.

## Steps

1. **Set up your button**: Configure your IoT button to connect with Zapier. This will vary depending on the button you're using, so refer to the button's documentation for specific instructions.

2. **Create a new Zap**: Log in to your Zapier account and click on 'Make a Zap'.

3. **Choose your trigger**: Select your IoT button as the trigger app and choose the 'Button Pressed' event. Follow the prompts to connect your button to Zapier.

4. **Choose your action app**: Select your scheduling tool (like Calendly) as the action app. Choose the 'Create Event' or similar action.

5. **Set up the action**: Follow the prompts to connect your scheduling tool to Zapier. In the 'Set up action' step, enter the details of the meeting you want to schedule. This will typically include the meeting title, duration, and the recipients' email addresses.

6. **Test your Zap**: Click on 'Test & Continue' to make sure your Zap works as expected. If everything is set up correctly, your scheduling tool should send out a meeting invite to the specified recipients when you press your button.

7. **Turn on your Zap**: If the test is successful, turn on your Zap. Now, whenever you press your button, it will trigger the Zap and send out a scheduling link to quickly set up meetings.

Remember, you can always modify the details of the meeting or the list of recipients in your Zap's action settings. Enjoy your new automated meeting scheduler!
